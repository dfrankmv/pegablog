## About the "Delete item" action

This action is pretty simple and straightforward: It just removes an item from a Table or a Repeating Dynamic Layout. 

First of all, we can find this action in the List category as shown in the next image.

We can use this action inside a row in a Table or a section in a Repeating Dynamic Layout.

<div class="block warning">
    In order for the action to work, it is necessary to make the row Inline editable.

</div>

The following animation shows the effect of the _Delete item_ action (applied to the ðŸ—‘ icon) in a Table.

The following animation shows the effect of the _Delete item_ action (applied to the "Remove" button) in a Repeating Dynamic Layout.

The good thing about this action is that it actually removes the page from the pagelist, so it's not just a visual effect. The following animation shows how the page _CountryList.pxResults(2)_ is removed from both the Pagelist and the Table.

<div class="block important">
    If the data source is a <strong>Data Page</strong> in <strong>read only</strong> mode, then the <em>Delete item</em> action won't be able to remove the page from the Data Page list.

</div>
