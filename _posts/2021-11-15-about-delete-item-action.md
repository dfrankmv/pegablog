## About the "Delete item" action

This action is pretty simple and straightforward: It just removes an item from a table or repeating dynamic layout. 

First of all, we can find this action in the List category as shown in the next image.

We can use this action inside a row in a _Table_ or a section in a _Repeating Dynamic Layout_. For example, in the following images we have added the Delete item action in the ðŸ—‘ icon and in the "Remove" button.
